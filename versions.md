## Release Notes by Version

### 2.9.0 — New Terrain Editor & Foreign Models Support
**Released:** June 9, 2026

**Overview:** This release introduces a new Terrain editor, allows loading and adding foreign models from different levels, and fixes bugs including pause menu list expand/collapse and immediate 3D viewport rings refresh.

### 2.8.0 — Inline AI Script Editor & Autocomplete Overhaul
**Released:** June 4, 2026

**Overview:** This release adds a full inline AI script mini-editor directly inside the property panel for HumanSoldier and HumanAI tasks, fixes three broken keyboard shortcuts in the find system, and overhauled autocomplete so it works correctly in every text field including the new AI script box.

**Key Improvements:**
- 🤖 **Inline AI Script Editor** — When a HumanSoldier or HumanAI task is selected, the property panel now shows a single-line path box and a tall multiline script textbox showing the decompiled QSC source from the correct `ai/XXXX.qvm` file (uses HumanAI child task's ID, not the parent soldier's ID).
- 📝 **Mini-Notepad Text Editor** — The AI script textbox is a proper text editor: vertical scrolling (mouse wheel + PageUp/PageDown), arrow key cursor navigation (left/right by character, up/down by visual line), mouse click to position cursor accurately, proper `\n`-aware text wrapping, and blinking cursor with yellow highlight border when active.
- 📂 **Path Box Horizontal Scroll** — The AI Script Path textbox scrolls horizontally with arrow keys and caret tracking, handles long file paths cleanly.
- 💾 **Compile-on-Save** — Edits to the AI script are compiled back to the `.qvm` file only when the user saves the level (F3 / Save button), with round-trip validation. The "modified" label turns orange when unsaved edits exist.
- 🔡 **Autocomplete Everywhere** — Fixed a field-ID guard bug (`< 0` instead of `== -1`) that silently blocked Ctrl+N, Ctrl+Space, and Ctrl+O in every text field. All autocomplete paths now work in AI fields and all standard fields.
- 📌 **Caret-Preserving Autocomplete** — When Ctrl+N opens the keyword picker, the cursor position is saved. Confirming a pick INSERTs the keyword at that saved position in the AI script box (rather than replacing the entire script), while regular string fields keep the existing replace behaviour.
- ⌨️ **TaskFindTextInTask Rebound** — `Ctrl+H` (ASCII backspace conflict) rebound to `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
- ⌨️ **TaskFindByTaskNote Fixed** — `Ctrl+Shift+N` was being consumed by the Ctrl+N autocomplete intercept; now properly falls through to `DispatchEventBindings`.
- ⌨️ **TaskFindAgain Scrolls Tree** — `Ctrl+Shift+F` now scrolls and highlights the found task in the tree view after each press.

**Files Modified:**
- `source/app.cpp` — AI script load/compile, arrow key handler, mouse click caret, autocomplete fixes, find-shortcut fixes, scroll helpers
- `source/app.h` — AI script state fields (`ai_script_path_`, `ai_script_text_`, `ai_script_dirty_`, `ai_script_vscroll_`, `ai_script_path_hscroll_`), picker caret field
- `source/renderer/renderer.cpp` — rewritten `draw_edit_box` with `\n` support + scrolling, AI widget rendering with box background/border
- `source/renderer/renderer.h` — `AIScriptPath`/`AIScriptText` widget kinds, sentinel constants, new params struct fields
- `assets/content/qed/qedkeybindings.qsc` — rebound `TaskFindTextInTask` to `Ctrl+Shift+X`
- `version` — bumped to 2.8.0

**Compatibility:** Backward compatible. Existing levels and configurations work without modification.

- 🔤 **Task Autocomplete** — Added sidebar auto-complete task picker and inline keyword auto-complete suggestions for faster and safer task editing.
- ⌨️ **Exact Keybinding Match** — Refactored key binding validation to require exact modifier match, resolving keyboard shortcut collision bugs.
- 🔧 **Task Tree & Save/Load** — Added task tree file dialog for subtree export/import, task placement at camera position, and robust qedkeybindings configuration serialization.

**Files Modified:**
- `source/app.cpp` — key bindings, panels, sub-task save/load, autocomplete loading
- `source/config.cpp` — keybindings loading and saving robustness
- `source/renderer/renderer.cpp` — 3D model viewer render path, picker panels

### 2.4.0 — Position Editor Drag & All-Object Picking
**Released:** May 28, 2026

**Overview:** This release fixes the frustrating "stuck cursor" issue when editing object positions near window edges, and enables clicking any model—even collision-only meshes.

**Key Improvements:**
- 🖱️ **Edge Continuity Logic** — Detects when cursor hits window edge (3px threshold) and substitutes last known drag delta
- ⏸️ **Per-Frame Delta Processing** — Prevents stalling when cumulative deltas hit zero at window boundary
- 🚗 **Collision-Mesh Picking** — Vehicles, cargo, and other collision-only geometry now serve as pick targets
- 🔧 **MEF Attachment Fallback** — All sub-models pickable via any mesh surface

**Files Modified:**
- `source/app.cpp` — edge-stuck detection, last-delta storage, delta reset on release
- `source/renderer/renderer_objects.cpp` — removed !fromRenderMesh guards in picking pass
- `source/renderer/renderer.h` — prop_last_drag_dx_, prop_last_drag_dy_ fields

**Behavior Change:** Objects now move continuously when cursor is stuck; clear on release.

### 2.3.0 — Font Toggle & Text Cursor Alignment
**Released:** May 24, 2026

**Overview:** Adds runtime font switching in the pause menu and fixes text cursor positioning to align with actual character advance widths.

**Key Improvements:**

- ✏️ **Glyph-Aware Cursor** — Text cursor calculated from per-character advance widths, not fixed pixel width
- 🧹 **Debug Button Removal** — Replaced unused Debug with functional font control
- 📐 **Variable-Width Support** — Supports both fixed and proportional fonts

**Files Modified:**
- `source/renderer/renderer.cpp` — font toggle label, text cursor calculation, measure_text_width helper
- `source/app.cpp` — font toggle click handler in pause menu
- `source/config.cpp/h` — systemFontSize configuration field

**Behavior Change:** Pause menu now has Font button; text cursors align perfectly.

### 2.2.0 — Building Interior Occlusion & Door Selection
**Released:** May 20, 2026

**Overview:** Improves the visibility culling system to hide only true interior sub-structures while keeping surface attachments (doors, lights, cameras) clickable from outside.

**Key Improvements:**
- 🏢 **Selective Child Occlusion** — Only hides children with isBuilding=true; doors/lights/cameras (non-building types) remain visible
- 🔍 **Ancestor Traversal** — Walks full parent chain to find nearest building ancestor instead of one-level check
- 🚪 **Exterior Attachment Support** — Building-attached objects properly selectable from outside
- 🌳 **Complex Nesting** — Sub-children of buildings now properly evaluated in picking pass

**Files Modified:**
- `source/renderer/renderer_objects.cpp` — ancestor traversal in DrawForPicking, building-interior occlusion logic
