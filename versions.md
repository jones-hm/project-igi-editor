## Release Notes by Version

### 2.5.0 — Property Panel Scrolling & Child Task Display
**Released:** June 2, 2026

**Overview:** This release adds a fully scrollable property editor with child task field display, making it easier to browse and reference large task schemas without switching views.

**Key Improvements:**
- 📋 **Vertical Panel Scrolling** — Mouse-wheel scrolling within the property panel with visual scrollbar
- 🔗 **Child Task Inline Display** — Weapon, ammo, and AI sub-task fields shown as read-only rows below parent
- 🎯 **Scroll State Persistence** — Scroll position managed per-object selection
- ✨ **GL Scissor Clipping** — Content properly clipped to panel bounds during scroll

**Files Modified:**
- `source/app.cpp` — scroll field wiring, mouse-wheel handler, scroll reset on selection
- `source/renderer/renderer.cpp` — property panel rendering with scissor test, child field display
- `source/renderer/renderer.h` — prop_panel_scroll_ field in task_tree_view_params_s

**Compatibility:** Fully backward compatible. Previous levels and configurations work without modification.

### 2.4.0 — Position Editor Drag & All-Object Picking
**Released:** May 28, 2026

**Overview:** This release fixes the frustrating "stuck cursor" issue when editing object positions near window edges, and enables clicking any model—even collision-only meshes.

**Key Improvements:**
- 🖱️ **Edge Continuity Logic** — Detects when cursor hits window edge (3px threshold) and substitutes last known drag delta
- ⏸️ **Per-Frame Delta Processing** — Prevents stalling when cumulative deltas hit zero at window boundary
- 🚗 **Collision-Mesh Picking** — Vehicles, cargo, and other collision-only geometry now serve as pick targets
- 🔧 **MEF Attachment Fallback** — All sub-models pickable via any mesh surface

**Files Modified:**
- `source/app.cpp` — edge-stuck detection, last-delta storage, delta reset on release
- `source/renderer/renderer_objects.cpp` — removed !fromRenderMesh guards in picking pass
- `source/renderer/renderer.h` — prop_last_drag_dx_, prop_last_drag_dy_ fields

**Behavior Change:** Objects now move continuously when cursor is stuck; clear on release.

### 2.3.0 — Font Toggle & Text Cursor Alignment
**Released:** May 24, 2026

**Overview:** Adds runtime font switching in the pause menu and fixes text cursor positioning to align with actual character advance widths.

**Key Improvements:**
- 🔤 **Live Font Toggle** — New pause menu button switches between Editor Font and System Font at runtime
- ✏️ **Glyph-Aware Cursor** — Text cursor calculated from per-character advance widths, not fixed pixel width
- 🧹 **Debug Button Removal** — Replaced unused Debug with functional font control
- 📐 **Variable-Width Support** — Supports both fixed and proportional fonts

**Files Modified:**
- `source/renderer/renderer.cpp` — font toggle label, text cursor calculation, measure_text_width helper
- `source/app.cpp` — font toggle click handler in pause menu
- `source/config.cpp/h` — systemFontSize configuration field

**Behavior Change:** Pause menu now has Font button; text cursors align perfectly.

### 2.2.0 — Building Interior Occlusion & Door Selection
**Released:** May 20, 2026

**Overview:** Improves the visibility culling system to hide only true interior sub-structures while keeping surface attachments (doors, lights, cameras) clickable from outside.

**Key Improvements:**
- 🏢 **Selective Child Occlusion** — Only hides children with isBuilding=true; doors/lights/cameras (non-building types) remain visible
- 🔍 **Ancestor Traversal** — Walks full parent chain to find nearest building ancestor instead of one-level check
- 🚪 **Exterior Attachment Support** — Building-attached objects properly selectable from outside
- 🌳 **Complex Nesting** — Sub-children of buildings now properly evaluated in picking pass

**Files Modified:**
- `source/renderer/renderer_objects.cpp` — ancestor traversal in DrawForPicking, building-interior occlusion logic

**Behavior Change:** Doors, lights, and cameras on building exteriors are now selectable from outside; interior sub-structures remain hidden.

### 2.1.0 — Windows DPI Scaling & Windowed-Mode Precision
**Released:** May 15, 2026

**Overview:** Fixes cursor precision issues in windowed mode on high-DPI displays (125%, 150%, and higher scaling).

**Key Improvements:**
- 💻 **DPI Awareness Declaration** — SetProcessDpiAwarenessContext for per-monitor DPI support
- 🎯 **Pixel-Perfect Hit-Testing** — Mouse coordinates match physical framebuffer pixels exactly
- 📱 **Multi-Monitor Support** — Works with external displays at different scaling factors
- 🔧 **Runtime Fallback** — Automatic DPI scale detection if OS manifest unavailable

**Files Modified:**
- `source/main.cpp` — SetProcessDpiAwarenessContext call before glutInit
- `source/app.cpp` — DPI scale member, runtime detection logic
- `source/app.h` — dpi_scale_ field

**Impact:** Sliders, textboxes, and buttons respond exactly under cursor on all DPI scaling levels.
