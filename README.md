# IGI Editor

**IGI Editor** is a professional 3D world and object manipulation toolkit for Project IGI. Inspired by the original IGI and IGI 2 editors, it provides a modern interface for level research, object placement, and terrain modification.

This project is built upon the foundational work of the [Project-IGI-Terrain](https://github.com/hjcminus/Project-IGI-Terrain) repository. Special thanks to [hjcminus](https://github.com/hjcminus) for their research and for bringing this codebase to light. It is built using C++17 and OpenGL, and it is cross-platform, but it is mainly tested on Windows.

Written and maintained by **Jones-HM (Heaven)**.

## 🚀 Features

- **3D Object Placement & Manipulation**: Load and render OBJ models with advanced 6-DOF controls.
- **IGI 2 Style Controls**: Seamless object manipulation using mouse-drags and keyboard modifiers (Shift, Ctrl, A, B, G).
- **Terrain Height Editing**: Integrated height-map brushes for real-time terrain sculpting.
- **Advanced Rendering**: OpenGL-based pipeline with full texture support, wireframe overlays, and skydome rendering.
- **Level Navigation**: Full support for loading and exploring all 13 original IGI levels.
- **Precision Snapping**: Instant ground-snapping logic to ensure objects sit perfectly on the terrain surface.

## 📂 Folder Structure

The IGI Editor utilizes a standardized Windows AppData structure for asset management, ensuring your project files remain organized and accessible across updates.

- **`%APPDATA%/QEditor/QFiles/IGI_QSC/`**: The primary repository for original IGI level data (CTR, CMD, HMP, etc.).
- **`%APPDATA%/QEditor/3DEditor/objects/level[1...14]/`**: Level-specific 3D model storage for `.obj` and `.mef` files.
- **`%APPDATA%/QEditor/3DEditor/textures/level[1...14]/`**: Dedicated texture storage for level assets in `.png` or `.tga` format.

Local Repository Folders:
- **`shaders/`**: Core OpenGL GLSL shader source files.
- **`bin/`**: Pre-compiled binaries and required dynamic libraries (DLLs).

## 🛠️ Future Roadmap

This editor is focused on providing professional-grade tools for Project IGI modding. Upcoming milestones include:
- **AI & Waypoint Editing**: Define complex NPC behaviors and navigation paths.
- **Weapon & Item Management**: Integrated UI for modifying weapon statistics and battlefield placements.
- **Task Tree Editor**: A visual editor for mission objectives and task tree logic, inspired by IGI 2.
- **Native QSC/QVM Integration**: Real-time script debugging and interaction within the 3D viewport.
