# IGI Editor

**IGI Editor** is a professional 3D world and object manipulation toolkit for Project IGI. Inspired by the original IGI and IGI 2 editors, it provides a modern interface for level research, object placement, and terrain modification.

**Current Status: BETA 0.0.9** - Professional modding suite introducing Global Model Database Search, UI Telemetry indicators, Cutscene Graph Area Protection, AppData syncing, Live Editor Real-Time Sync, and Task Tree Objective Editing. Supports all levels including Level 14 with a modern GLB-based asset pipeline.

This project is built upon the foundational work of the [Project-IGI-Terrain](https://github.com/hjcminus/Project-IGI-Terrain) repository. Special thanks to [hjcminus](https://github.com/hjcminus) for their research and for bringing this codebase to light. It is built using C++17 and OpenGL, and it is cross-platform, but it is mainly tested on Windows.

Written and maintained by **Jones-HM (Heaven)**.

## 🚀 Features

- **Live Editor Real-Time Sync**: Direct communication between the editor and the IGI engine for instant visual feedback.
- **Task Tree Editor**: A visual workspace for managing mission objectives and complex task logic.
- **Spline Train Tracks**: Procedural spline system for generating and placing train tracks across levels.
- **3D Object Placement & Manipulation**: Load and render models with advanced 6-DOF controls.
- **IGI 2 Style Controls**: Seamless object manipulation using mouse-drags and keyboard modifiers (Shift, Ctrl, A, B, G).
- **Terrain Height Editing**: Integrated height-map brushes for real-time terrain sculpting.
- **Advanced Rendering**: OpenGL-based pipeline with full texture support, wireframe overlays, and skydome rendering.
- **Level Navigation**: Full support for loading and exploring all 14 original IGI levels.
- **Precision Snapping**: Instant ground-snapping logic to ensure objects sit perfectly on the terrain surface.

### Current Testing Status
- **Building Editor**: Working - tested with Building objects
- **Terrain Editor**: Working - height map editing functional
- **Model Format**: Currently using **GLB (binary glTF)** format where textures and models are combined for optimal performance in OpenGL.
- **Object Library**: The `QEditor\3DEditor` directory contains pre-defined 3D objects that the editor loads and allows users to manipulate.
- **Level Tested**: Full support for all 14 levels.

### ⚠️ Known Issues
- **Fence Wire**: Rendering and placement of fence wiring is currently not solved.
- **Complex Splines**: Some complex spline geometries are still work-in-progress and may exhibit artifacts.

### Future Work
- **Mef Parser**: Developing a native parser for .mef model files.
- **AI & Waypoint Editing**: Define complex NPC behaviors and navigation paths.
- **Weapon & Item Management**: Integrated UI for modifying weapon statistics and battlefield placements.

## Folder Structure

### QEditor AppData Structure (`%APPDATA%/QEditor/`)

The editor requires QEditor to be installed in AppData for QSC/QVM compilation and decompilation:

- **`QFiles/IGI_QSC/`**: Original IGI level data (CTR, CMD, HMP, QSC scripts) organized by:
  - `missions/location0/level[1-14]/` - Level-specific scripts, AI, sounds, terrain
  - `ammo/`, `weapons/`, `common/` - Shared game data
- **`QFiles/IGI_QVM/`**: Compiled QVM files for all levels
- **`QCompiler/`**: Compilation tools (Compile, Decompile, DConv, GConv, TexConv, etc.)
- **`3DEditor/objects/level[1-14]/`**: Level-specific 3D model storage (`.obj`, `.mef`)
- **`3DEditor/textures/level[1-14]/`**: Texture storage for level assets (`.png`, `.tga`)
- **`3DEditor/buildings/level[1-14]/`**: Building model storage
- **`AIFiles/`**: AI data (AI-Json, AI-Path, AI-Script) per level
- **`QGraphs/`**: Area and graph data for levels
- **`QMissions/`**: Mission configuration files
- **`QWeapons/`**: Weapon group and modification data

### Local Repository Folders
- **`shaders/`**: Core OpenGL GLSL shader source files
- **`bin/`**: Pre-compiled binaries and required dynamic libraries (DLLs)
- **`assets/`**: Editor assets (screenshots, icons)

## 🛠️ Future Roadmap

This editor is focused on providing professional-grade tools for Project IGI modding. Upcoming milestones include:
- **AI & Waypoint Editing**: Define complex NPC behaviors and navigation paths.
- **Weapon & Item Management**: Integrated UI for modifying weapon statistics and battlefield placements.
- **Task Tree Editor**: A visual editor for mission objectives and task tree logic, inspired by IGI 2.
- **Native QSC/QVM Integration**: Real-time script debugging and interaction within the 3D viewport.

## 💻 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **OS**: Windows (x64)
- **Compiler**: MSVC (Visual Studio 2022 recommended)
- **Build System**: CMake
- **QEditor**: Required for QSC/QVM compilation and decompilation.
- **IGI Game**: Full installation of Project IGI required for level data and assets

### Build Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the directory in a terminal.
3. Run the following commands:
   ```powershell
   cmake -B build -S .
   cmake --build build --config Release
   ```
4. Launch the editor:
   ```powershell
   .\bin\Release\igi-editor.exe -level 1 -draw_parts 49 -stick_to_ground
   ```

## 🔄 How It Works

### Editor Flow

* Editor first copies terrain files from QEditor folder to the executable directory
* Then it finds the latest objects file (QSC or QVM) by checking timestamps across multiple locations (editor, QEditor, IGI game)
* If QVM is newest, it decompiles it to QSC; if QSC is newest, it copies and compiles to QVM to keep everything in sync
* Editor loads the QSC file and parses level data including object positions, rotations, and model references
* Then it loads the terrain heightmap, textures, and lightmaps for rendering and editing
* Next, it loads all 3D models (buildings and props) with their textures and positions them according to QSC data
* Objects are automatically snapped to the terrain surface to ensure correct placement
* Camera is positioned at the level start coordinates and editor is ready for editing
* When you save changes, the editor writes to objects.qsc, compiles it to objects.qvm, and copies it to the IGI game path
