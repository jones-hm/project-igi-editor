# IGI Editor

**IGI Editor** is a professional 3D world and object manipulation toolkit for Project IGI. Inspired by the official [IGI 2 Editor](https://www.nexusmods.com/igi2covertstrike/mods/1) created by the original IGI Developers, it provides a modern interface for level research, object placement, and terrain modification.

**Current Status: Version 2.6.0 (Properties Editor UI & Attachments Support)** - Professional 3D modding suite featuring click-to-select map selection, train and spline tools, a streamlined workspace menu, automated asset extraction, flawless native MEF model loading (including complex buildings and bone structures), integrated QVM decompilation, and a full headless CLI toolchain. Supports editing and compiling for all 14 original game levels with native asset parity.

This project is built upon the foundational work of the [Project-IGI-Terrain](https://github.com/hjcminus/Project-IGI-Terrain) repository. Special thanks to [hjcminus](https://github.com/hjcminus) for their research and for bringing this codebase to light. It is built using C++17 and OpenGL, and it is cross-platform, but it is mainly tested on Windows.

Written and maintained by **Heaven-HM**.

### ⚠️ Known Issues
A comprehensive list of all known rendering, game, and engine issues can be found in our **[Known Issues Guide](docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md)**. Key issues currently include:
- **Fence Wire**: Rendering and placement of secondary fence wiring is currently not solved.
- **Level 7 Cutscenes**: Model `003_01_1` (PATROL_AK) does not draw properly due to missing texture coordinates in cutscene context.
- **Metal Doors (L12-14)**: Slide-up doors fail to acquire standard orientations because the levels configure them as `EditRigidObj` instead of `Door`.
- **Train Tracks (L1, 9, 10)**: Spline railway lines appear jagged over bridges and lack smooth curve interpolation.
- **Cutscene Editing Crashes**: Editing `AnimationTask` or other timeline nodes can lead to game engine crashes due to bytecode script offset mismatches.

### Future Work
- **Expanded Sandbox Modding**: Expanding item drop coordinates, trigger boundary visualizers, and ammo boxes placements.
- **Full Campaign Testing**: Continuing rigorous end-to-end testing across levels 4 through 14.

## Folder Structure

### QEditor AppData Structure (`%APPDATA%/QEditor/`)

The editor requires QEditor to be installed in AppData for QSC/QVM compilation and decompilation:

- **`QFiles/IGI_QSC/`**: Original IGI level data (CTR, CMD, HMP, QSC scripts) organized by:
  - `missions/location0/level[1-14]/` - Level-specific scripts, AI, sounds, terrain
  - `ammo/`, `weapons/`, `common/` - Shared game data
- **`QFiles/IGI_QVM/`**: Compiled QVM files for all levels
- **`QCompiler/`**: Compilation tools (Compile, Decompile, DConv, GConv, TexConv, etc.)
- **`3DEditor/objects/level[1-14]/`**: Level-specific 3D model storage (proprietary `.mef` models, `.obj` files)
- **`3DEditor/buildings/level[1-14]/`**: Building model storage (proprietary `.mef` models)
- **`AIFiles/`**: AI data (AI-Json, AI-Path, AI-Script) per level
- **`QGraphs/`**: Area and graph data for levels
- **`QMissions/`**: Mission configuration files
- **`QWeapons/`**: Weapon group and modification data

### Local Repository Folders
- **`shaders/`**: Core OpenGL GLSL shader source files
- **`bin/`**: Pre-compiled binaries and required dynamic libraries (DLLs)
- **`assets/`**: Editor assets (icons, screenshots in `assets/screenshots/`)

## 🛠️ Future Roadmap

With the successful release of **Version 2.0.0**, core features like the **Native MEF Parser**, **Asset Extractor**, **QVM Toolchain**, **Task Tree Editor**, **Train & Spline Engine**, **Click-to-Select Map View**, and **Headless CLI** have been fully realized. Future milestones include:
- **Visual 3D Graph Editor (Coming Soon)**: A full-featured Visual 3D Graph Editor displaying interactive nodes and visuals to seamlessly construct game logic, path routes, and area connections.
- **Weapon & Item Configurator**: Rich telemetry overlays and visual UI for modifying active gun parameters, ammunition slots, and dropping custom inventory directly onto the battlefield.

## 💻 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **OS**: Windows (x86)
- **Compiler**: MSVC (Visual Studio 2022 recommended)
- **Build System**: CMake
- **QEditor**: Required for QSC/QVM compilation and decompilation.
- **IGI Game**: Full installation of Project IGI required for level data and assets

### Build Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the directory in a terminal.
3. Run the following commands to build for **32-bit (Win32)**:
   ```powershell
   # Clean previous build if necessary
   if (Test-Path build) { Remove-Item build -Recurse -Force }

   # Configure for 32-bit (Win32) using a specific Visual Studio instance
   cmake -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A Win32 -DCMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE="C:/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio/2022/Community"

   # Build in Release mode
   cmake --build build --config Release
   ```
4. Launch the editor:
   ```powershell
   .\bin\Release\igi1ed.exe -level 1 -draw_parts 49 -stick_to_ground
   ```

   #### 🎨 Selective Loading and Drawing (`-draw_parts` Bitmask)
   You can customize what parts of the level to load and render using the `-draw_parts` bitmask argument:
   
   * **Only Buildings with Terrain** (Bitmask: `17` = `1` Terrain + `16` Buildings)
     ```powershell
     .igi1ed.exe -level 1 -draw_parts 17 -stick_to_ground
     ```
   * **Only Objects/Props with Terrain** (Bitmask: `33` = `1` Terrain + `32` Objects/Props)
     ```powershell
     .igi1ed.exe -level 1 -draw_parts 33 -stick_to_ground
     ```
   * **Only AI Units with Terrain** (Bitmask: `65` = `1` Terrain + `64` AI)
     ```powershell
     .igi1ed.exe -level 1 -draw_parts 65 -stick_to_ground
     ```
     *(Note: AI models are stored as non-building objects (props) inside the engine. To visually render the 3D meshes of the AI units, combine with props to get `-draw_parts 97` which is `1` + `32` + `64`)*

### 🧪 Unit Testing & Status

We use **GoogleTest** (gtest) for a comprehensive test suite covering the core parsers and utilities. Tests run automatically as part of the build with `ctest`.

#### Current Test Status

| Module / Test Suite | Status | Passing Tests | Coverage |
| --- | :---: | :---: | --- |
| **QSC Lexer** (`QscLexerTest`) | ✅ | 52/52 | All token types, keywords, comments, operators, escape sequences, positions, error recovery |
| **QSC Parser** (`QscParserTest`) | ✅ | 37/37 | All AST node types, operator precedence, control flow, error cases, counter tracking |
| **QVM Round-Trip** (`QvmRoundTripTest`) | ✅ | 20/20 | Compile→write→parse→decompile cycle, identifier/string pools, structural re-parse |
| **Configuration** (`ConfigTest`) | ✅ | 10/10 | Defaults, field ranges, singleton behaviour, keybinding load |
| **String Utilities** (`UtilsTest`) | ✅ | 35/35 | `Trim`, `Split`, `TryParse<T>`, `ToString<T>` with edge cases |
| **Overall** | ✅ | **158/158 (100%)** | |

#### Test Files

| File | Tests | What it covers |
| --- | :---: | --- |
| `tests/test_qsc_lexer.cpp` | 52 | Tokenisation of every token kind, comment stripping, escape sequences, qualified identifiers, source positions, all error paths |
| `tests/test_qsc_parser.cpp` | 37 | AST structure for calls, `if`/`else`, `while`, all binary/unary operators, precedence, right-associativity, empty programs, error paths |
| `tests/test_qvm_roundtrip.cpp` | 20 | Full compile → disk → parse → decompile pipeline for 12 QSC variants; QVM pool checks; re-lex/re-parse of decompiler output |
| `tests/test_config.cpp` | 10 | Config singleton, level range, font/render defaults, keybinding data loaded |
| `tests/test_utils.cpp` | 35 | `Trim` (12 cases), `Split` (7 cases), `TryParse<int/float/double>` (10 cases), `ToString` (5 cases) |

#### How to Run Tests

**Quick run (after a fresh clone):**

```powershell
# 1. Configure
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

# 2. Build only the test binary (fast — skips the full editor)
cmake --build build --target igi_tests --config Debug

# 3. Run all 158 tests with failure details
cd build
ctest --output-on-failure -C Debug
```

**Run the binary directly for verbose output:**

```powershell
.\bin\Debug\igi_tests.exe
```

**Filter to a specific suite:**

```powershell
# Run only the lexer tests
.\bin\Debug\igi_tests.exe --gtest_filter="QscLexerTest.*"

# Run only the parser tests
.\bin\Debug\igi_tests.exe --gtest_filter="QscParserTest.*"

# Run only the QVM round-trip tests
.\bin\Debug\igi_tests.exe --gtest_filter="QvmRoundTripTest.*"
```

**Expected output on a clean pass:**

```
[==========] Running 158 tests from 5 test suites.
[  PASSED  ] 158 tests.
```

> **Note:** The test binary must be run from the repository root (not from inside `build/`) so that relative paths to `tests/fixtures/` resolve correctly. `ctest` handles this automatically via `WORKING_DIRECTORY`.

## 🔄 How It Works

### Editor Flow

* Editor first copies terrain files from QEditor folder to the executable directory
* Then it finds the latest objects file (QSC or QVM) by checking timestamps across multiple locations (editor, QEditor, IGI game)
* If QVM is newest, it decompiles it to QSC; if QSC is newest, it copies and compiles to QVM to keep everything in sync
* Editor loads the QSC file and parses level data including object positions, rotations, and model references
* Then it loads the terrain heightmap, textures, and lightmaps for rendering and editing
* Next, it loads all 3D models (buildings and props in native MEF format) and positions them according to QSC data
* Objects are automatically snapped to the terrain surface to ensure correct placement
* Camera is positioned at the level start coordinates and editor is ready for editing
* When you save changes, the editor writes to objects.qsc, compiles it to objects.qvm, and copies it to the IGI game path
