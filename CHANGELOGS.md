## 3.0.0 — igi1conv Integration, Qt Bundling, Module Refactor & Bug Fixes

This release is a major milestone: the standalone asset converter is now a first-class Qt application (`igi1conv`) living in its own repository, the editor codebase has been split into clearly separated modules, and a batch of code-review bugs has been resolved.

### 🔧 igi1conv — Standalone Asset Converter (Qt)
- **Dedicated repo**: `igi1conv` is developed at [project-igi-conv](https://github.com/jones-hm/project-igi-conv) and bundled prebuilt with each editor release.
- **Qt application**: Ships with a full graphical GUI mode and a headless CLI mode. The editor invokes only the CLI internally (`dat to-mtp`, etc.).
- **Full Qt package**: The entire runtime (exe + Qt5Core/Qt5Gui/Qt5Widgets/Qt5Svg DLLs, platform plugins, image formats) is bundled at `editor/tools/igi1conv/` — no separate Qt installation required.
- **v1.6.0**: Updated to `igi1conv` v1.6.0 with improved asset conversion accuracy.
- **Native MTP generation**: The editor delegates all `.mtp` generation to `igi1conv dat to-mtp`, which reproduces the original game `.mtp` byte-for-byte and fixes transparent/wrong-texture in-game issues.

### 🗂️ Module Refactor
- **renderer_objects** split into picking, mesh, visual, metadata, texture, and ATTA attachment subsystems.
- **app** split into `app_input` (mouse + keyboard + dispatch), `app_editor`, `app_view`, `app_lookup`, `app_level`, and `app_ui` modules.
- **terrain** implementation split into terrain_io, terrain_lod, terrain_mesh, and terrain_query.
- **LevelObjects** QSC serialization extracted into its own module.

### 🖥️ UI Improvements
- **Level Spinner**: Level number selector added to the pause menu for quick level switching.
- **Texture Panel Removed**: Texture list removed from the pause menu for a cleaner layout.
- **Editor File Verification on Launch**: Missing `editor/` directory files are detected and reported with a clear error dialog before the editor reaches the render loop.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Arrow Keys**: Arrow keys no longer move the camera unless `SHIFT+ALT` is held — fixes accidental camera drift during text input.
- **Weapon Orientation**: Corrected weapon/ammo model orientation so pickups display at the right angle in-game.
- **ESC Menu Re-open**: Fixed regression where pressing ESC a second time failed to reopen the pause menu.
- **Terrain Rings on Right-Click**: 3D brush rings now appear immediately when terrain is selected via right-click.
- **DAT Round-Trip Loss**: Fixed data loss when a DAT file was written back after read.
- **matCount Guard**: Added bounds check to prevent out-of-range material slot access.
- **`std::exit` replaced**: Replaced bare `std::exit` calls with proper cleanup paths.
- **VNAM Shadow**: Fixed variable shadowing bug in VNAM chunk parsing.
- **vert_info Overflow**: Corrected vertex info buffer overflow on large meshes.
- **JSON Parser**: Fixed edge-case crash in the embedded JSON parser on malformed input.
- **Boundary-Aware Texture Matching**: `009_01_1` can no longer accidentally grab `1009_01_1.tex`.

## 2.9.0 — New Terrain Editor, Foreign Models Support & UI Fixes
This release introduces a new Terrain editor, support for loading and adding foreign models from other levels, and critical bug fixes to the pause menu layout and viewport interaction.

### 🗺️ New Terrain Editor
- **Interactive Terrain Tools** — Enhanced level design capabilities with the new terrain editor interface and brush controls.

### 📦 Foreign Model Support
- **Cross-Level Assets** — Added the ability to import and add foreign models from different game levels directly into the current level.

### 🔧 Pause Menu & UI Bug Fixes
- **Terrain Options Expand/Collapse** — Fixed the list in Terrain Options in the Pause menu to properly expand and collapse when clicked.
- **Immediate 3D Rings Refresh** — When terrain is selected via right-click, the 3D brush rings now display immediately in the viewport without delay by forcing immediate frame redisplays.

## 2.8.0 — Inline AI Script Editor, Mini-Notepad, Autocomplete Overhaul & Find Fixes
This release delivers a full inline AI script editor embedded inside the property panel, a proper mini-notepad text editor with scrolling and arrow key navigation, a global autocomplete fix, and three keyboard shortcut corrections in the find system.

### 🤖 Inline AI Script Editor
- **Correct Task ID Resolution** — AI script path now uses the `HumanAI` child task's ID (e.g. `2203`) instead of the parent `HumanSoldier` ID, correctly pointing to `ai/2203.qvm`.
- **Path Textbox** — Editable single-line textbox showing the full `.qvm` path. Type a new path and press Enter to load and decompile that file. Horizontal scrolling keeps long paths visible.
- **Script Textbox** — Tall multiline textbox showing the decompiled QSC source. The orange "modified" label appears whenever unsaved edits exist.
- **Compile-on-Save** — AI script edits are compiled back to `.qvm` only when the user saves the level (F3 / Save), with round-trip validation. Errors are shown in the status bar; dirty flag stays set on failure.

### 📝 Mini-Notepad Text Editor
- **Vertical Scrolling** — Mouse wheel scrolls the script content. PageUp / PageDown jump a screen at a time.
- **Arrow Key Navigation** — Left/Right move the caret one character. Up/Down move by visual line, preserving the column position. Works correctly across `\n`-separated lines and wrapped lines.
- **Mouse Click Positioning** — Clicking inside the script box positions the caret at the character closest to the click, accounting for the current scroll offset.
- **Path Horizontal Scroll** — The path box scrolls horizontally as the caret moves past the visible area.
- **Proper `\n`-Aware Wrapping** — The `draw_edit_box` renderer now splits on `\n` characters AND wraps at the box width, showing each logical line correctly. Cursor is always on the right visual line.
- **Editable Appearance** — Both boxes now draw a dark background and a white/yellow border (yellow = active editing), matching the visual style of all other property fields.

### 🔡 Autocomplete Everywhere Fixed
- **Root Cause** — Field-ID sentinels for AI boxes are `-10`/`-11` (both `< 0`), which triggered a stale `prop_text_edit_field_ < 0` guard that blocked Ctrl+N, Ctrl+Space, and Ctrl+O in every field where they were hit. All guards now check `== -1`.
- **Ctrl+N / Ctrl+Space / Ctrl+O** — All autocomplete and picker paths now work in the AI script box, the AI path box, and all standard string fields.
- **Caret-Preserving Insert** — When Ctrl+N opens the keyword picker, the cursor position is captured (`picker_target_caret_`). Confirming a pick INSERTs the keyword at that exact position in the AI script box. Standard fields keep the existing full-replace behaviour.
- **DispatchEventBindings Paths Fixed** — `AutoCompleteTaskName` and `AutoCompleteModelName` event bindings also had the stale guard; both now fixed and save the caret on open.

### ⌨️ Find Shortcut Fixes
- **TaskFindTextInTask** — Rebound from `Ctrl+H` (ASCII 8 = Backspace, permanently blocked) to `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
- **TaskFindByTaskNote** — `Ctrl+Shift+N` was being silently swallowed by the Ctrl+N autocomplete intercept (both produce ASCII 14 in GLUT). Guard now checks `!shiftDown` so Ctrl+Shift+N correctly reaches `DispatchEventBindings`.
- **TaskFindAgain** — After finding the next match, `Ctrl+Shift+F` now scrolls the task tree so the found item is visible and highlighted.

## 2.7.0 - 3D Model Viewer, Autocomplete Task, Exact Keybindings & Task Tree Fixes
This release introduces an interactive rotating 3D Model Viewer for selected level assets, auto-complete for task inputs, and critical fixes for keybinding collisions and task subtree importing/exporting.

### 📐 3D Model Viewer
- **Real-time 3D Preview**: Renders a spinning 3D preview of the selected model inside the Model ID picker (`Ctrl+O`), loaded natively from MEF files.
- **Automatic Scaling and Orientation**: Preview models rotate automatically across dual axes and are scaled to fit the preview frame dynamically.

### 🔤 Task Autocomplete
- **Task Type Picker**: Added a dedicated sidebar autocomplete task type picker (`Ctrl+N` panel) with instant incremental search.
- **Inline Keyword Auto-complete**: Trigger keyword suggestions directly using `Ctrl+Space` for rapid task configuration.

### ⌨️ Exact Keybinding Validation
- **Modifier Exact Matching**: Dispatches event bindings only when key modifiers match exactly, preventing shortcuts like `Ctrl+C` from firing during `Ctrl+Shift+C` commands.
- **Autorotated Keybinding Config**: Preserves named configurations (`SaveSubTask`, `TaskMagicObjToggle`, etc.) directly from `qedkeybindings.qsc` instead of resetting them.

### 🔧 Task Tree & File Dialogs
- **Subtree Export & Import**: Save task subtrees to custom files and load them back onto target nodes dynamically.
- **Task Creation options**: Insert new tasks directly at the camera's coordinates or insert them at specific task tree locations.

---

## 2.6.0 - Properties Editor UI, Attachments, Splines & CLI Tools

- **PNG Encoding**: Integrated `stb_image_write.h` to natively write high-quality PNGs directly from the engine.

### 🔤 Font Output Improvements
- **FNT Atlas Export**: New `--export-png` flag for the `--fnt` parser extracts the internal bitmap texture of font files directly to PNG.
- **Glyph String Concatenation**: The `--fnt` info log now aggregates all active glyphs and prints them as a single string for quick character set verification.

### 🔧 Stability
- **Bug Fixes**: Fixed general bugs and improved overall editor stability.

## 2.4.0 - Position Editor Drag & All-Object Picking
This update fixes position editing when the cursor hits window edges and enables clicking collision-only meshes.

### 🖱️ Position Editor Edge Continuity
- **Stuck Cursor Handling**: When your mouse hits the window edge, the position editor now remembers your last drag direction and continues moving the object smoothly.
- **Per-Frame Delta Logic**: Switching from cumulative to per-frame drag delta prevents stalling when the cursor can't move further.
- **Seamless Manipulation**: No need to re-position your mouse—object keeps moving in the direction you were pushing.

### 🎯 Universal Object Picking
- **Collision-Mesh Fallback**: Vehicles, cargo containers, and other collision-only models are now clickable in the viewport, even without render geometry.
- **All Attachments Pickable**: MEF sub-models now serve as valid pick targets, allowing selection of child objects through any mesh surface.

---

## 2.3.0 - Font Toggle & Text Cursor Alignment
This release adds live font switching and precise text cursor positioning in property textboxes.

### 🔤 Font System Enhancements
- **Live Font Toggle**: New "Font: Editor / Font: System" button in pause menu switches between bitmap fonts at runtime without reloading.
- **Dynamic Font Switching**: All HUD text instantly updates when toggling fonts—no need to restart the editor.
- **Clean UI**: Removed unused Debug button and replaced with functional font control.

### ✏️ Text Editing Precision
- **Cursor-to-Glyph Alignment**: Text cursor now sits exactly where typed characters will appear, not offset to the right.
- **Per-Character Advances**: Cursor position calculated from actual glyph advance widths, supporting variable-width fonts.
- **Arrow Key Navigation**: Caret movement with arrow keys now aligns perfectly with the rendered text.

---

## 2.2.0 - Building Interior Occlusion & Door Selection
This release improves building visibility logic and allows selecting doors, lights, and cameras from outside.

### 🏢 Smart Building Occlusion
- **Selective Child Hiding**: Only interior sub-structures are hidden when viewing from outside; doors, lights, and security cameras remain clickable on exterior surfaces.
- **Exterior Attachment Support**: Building-attached objects (doors, alarms, cameras) are now properly selectable from outside without hiding them.
- **Ancestor Chain Traversal**: Complex nested building structures now correctly hide only true interior children, not surface attachments.

### 🔍 Improved Selection

This release focus on stabilizing complex object manipulation and providing essential safety features for level editing.

### 🔄 State Management & Safety
- **Multi-Step Undo/Redo**: Implemented a comprehensive Undo/Redo system for object manipulation. The editor now tracks level snapshots, allowing users to revert and redo changes with `CTRL+Z` and `CTRL+Y` (fully configurable via `qedkeybindings.qsc`).
- **Persistent State Fix**: Resolved a persistent bug where modifications to building objects were reset when selecting a different object.
- **Improved Change Tracking**: Updated `LevelObjects::SaveToQSC` to automatically clear stale cached lines for all modified objects, ensuring changes are always reflected in the underlying script.

### 📐 Precision Hierarchical Manipulation
- **Global Root Pivot Enforcement**: Fixed a critical bug in hierarchical rotation where child objects would drift or disappear. Nested descendants (furniture, items, AI) now rotate relative to the root building origin, ensuring perfect coordinate stability.
- **AI Graph Synchronization**: AI soldiers inside buildings now have their internal `graphPos` metadata automatically updated during building translation and rotation, maintaining pathing integrity.
- **Building Snap Preservation**: Refined hierarchical "Snap to Ground" and "Snap to Object" to ensure all child objects maintain their relative offsets after the parent snaps.
- **Snap Search Radius**: Added a 5000-unit search radius to "Snap to Object" for more predictable nearest-neighbor detection.

### 📜 Hierarchical Synchronization

- **Balanced Parenthesis Engine**: Completely refactored the QSC serialization engine to guarantee perfectly balanced parentheses and correct comma separation in saved mission files.

---

## 1.6.0 - Advanced QVM Configuration & In-Memory Logic
This update transitions the editor to a proprietary configuration system powered by the IGI bytecode engine.

### ⚙️ QSC/QVM Configuration System
- **Unified Config Standard**: Migrated all editor settings and keybindings from legacy `.txt` files to a robust `.qsc` (source) and `.qvm` (compiled) system.
- **In-Memory Decompilation**: Implemented `QVM_DecompileToString` in `qvm_decompiler.cpp`. The editor now parses compiled `.qvm` files and decompiles them directly into a RAM string for processing, eliminating temporary file overhead.
- **Automated Startup Compilation**: The editor now automatically scans the `content/qed/` directory and compiles any new or updated `.qsc` configuration scripts to `.qvm` bytecode at launch.
- **QED Prefix Enforcement**: Enforced a new project-wide convention where all configuration keys must be prefixed with `QED` (e.g., `QEDFontSize`, `QEDLevel`) and lines terminate with a semicolon (`;`).

### 🛠️ Advanced QED Parameters
- **New Engine Parameters**: Added support for 20+ advanced configuration settings including `QEDConsoleAutoActivate`, `QEDSearchType`, `QEDInvertMouse`, `QEDDisplayTaskNote`, and `QEDCameraLock`.
- **Dynamic File Overrides**: Implemented `QEDSetObjectFile("path")` with support for `LOCAL:` path resolution, allowing modders to load specific object scripts for rapid testing.
- **Camera State Persistence**: Added configuration support for initial camera orientation, radius, and matrices, allowing the viewport to restore its exact state between sessions.

---

## 1.5.0 - Asset Extraction & Advanced Native Fixes
This release introduces automated asset extraction and addresses critical rendering and caching bugs for complex native models.

### 📦 Automated Asset Management
- **Level Asset Extractor**: Implemented a robust `AssetExtractor` system that automatically unzips textures and models from `.res` archives into the editor's working directory on-demand (`--extract-level` CLI).
- **Timestamp Caching**: Added file-timestamp validation to ensure `.res` extraction only occurs when necessary, drastically improving level loading speeds across sessions.
- **Level Cache Isolation**: Fixed critical caching bugs where meshes and textures from a previously loaded level (e.g., Level 4) would bleed into the active level (e.g., Level 1). The engine now completely purges the GL mesh, texture, and DAT map caches when switching levels.

### 📐 Advanced Native Rendering Fixes
- **Bone Model Geometry (Type-1)**: Fixed an issue where character models (like `013_01_1` and `003_02_1`) failed to load faces. The `ParseSplitBoneTriangles` parser now dynamically scans all ECAF offsets across out-of-order blocks to accurately calculate missing triangle counts.
- **Building Floors & Collision Rendering (Type-3)**: Fixed a major rendering bug where multi-room buildings were missing their floors. The editor now correctly extracts `XTVC`/`ECFC` collision chunks (where the original game engine stores untextured structural elements like floors and ramps) and appends them as standalone untextured render blocks.
- **Precision Z-Offset Snapping**: Refined the terrain snapping system (`mainZOffset`) for buildings. The calculation now strictly utilizes the lowest Z-coordinate of *textured* submeshes, preventing invisible underground foundations from interfering with accurate floor-to-terrain alignment.

---

## 1.4.0 - Native Game Engine Parity & Toolchain Expansion
This major release marks the complete transition to the Project IGI native file ecosystem. The editor now directly parses and manages proprietary game assets, providing pixel-perfect parity with the original game engine and a robust headless toolset for modders.

- **Bone & Rigging Support**: Full support for character bone hierarchies, rig mapping, and animation playback structures.
- **Native TEX Loader**: Direct support for IGI Texture formats (Version 7, Mode 67 BGRA8888) with mipmap and transparency handling.
- **RES Archive Parser**: Built-in ILFF/IRES archive management for dynamic asset extraction from original game resource files.
- **MTP Package Support**: Implementation of the FORM/IFF structured texture mapping parser for complex model-texture packaging.

### 📜 Integrated Scripting & VM Toolchain
- **QVM Decompiler**: Robust reverse-engineering of IGI bytecode (Version 0.5) back to human-readable QSC scripts.
- **QCompiler Pipeline**: Seamless integration of mission logic compilation, enabling direct saving of QSC changes into game-ready QVM binaries.
- **Bytecode Verification**: Automated integrity checks for compiled scripts to ensure stability in the game engine.

### 💻 Headless CLI & Automation
- **Unified Headless Toolset**: Added advanced command-line switches to `igi1ed.exe` for automated workflows:
  - `--extract-level <num>`: Batch extract all level resources (Models, Textures, Terrain).
  - `--mef <file>`: Detailed model geometry and bone structure analysis.
  - `--qsc/--qvm`: CLI-based compilation and decompilation routines.
  - `--res/--mtp`: Archive listing and specific block extraction.
  - `--terrain`: Raw heightmap and lightmap structure analysis.

### 🚀 Performance & Systems Optimization
- **AssetExtractor**: Intelligent management system for level data with file-timestamp caching to prevent redundant extractions.
- **Unified Logger**: Level-specific instrumentation with debug dump support and improved UI telemetry.
- **AppData Synchronization**: Automated migration and locking between local editor folders and `%APPDATA%\QEditor`.

- **Level Loading Fixes**: Resolved critical crashes when switching between different game levels.

---

## BETA 0.0.4 - Clean Persistence & QSC Integrity
### Object Serialization Stabilization
- **Intentional Change Tracking**: Introduced a `modified` flag for all level objects. The editor now only saves changes for objects you've actually interacted with (moved, rotated) or that were updated during an AI synchronization.
- **QSC Data Preservation**: Fixed "Sticky Snapping" by decoupling the visual terrain snap from the saved QSC coordinates. The original file position is now preserved unless explicitly moved by the user.
- **Minimal Diffs on Save**: By using the `modified` flag, the editor now performs minimal line rewrites in `objects.qsc`, keeping the rest of the file's formatting, indentation, and floating-point precision intact.

### Manual Manipulation & Snapping
- **Manual Snap Guard**: Integrated the underground check into the manual snap key ('S') and reset key ('Space') to prevent accidental displacement of structural components during editing.

---

## BETA 0.0.3 - AI Logic & Stabilization
### AI Logic Fixes
- **Fixed AI Rotation Over-match**: Resolved a critical issue where objects containing "ai" in their name (e.g., "Chair", "Container") were incorrectly identified as AI units and had their rotation forced to 360 degrees.
- **Improved Type Safety**: The editor now explicitly identifies object types (`Building`, `EditRigidObj`, `HumanSoldier`) during the load phase to ensure level-specific rules apply only to the correct units.

### Structural Persistence
- **Robust "Joint Fixer" Exclusion**: Enhanced `IsUndergroundModel` logic with broad keyword support and string normalization to prevent structural models (tunnels, junctions, joint fixers) from snapping to the terrain.
- **Refined Matching**: Implemented case-insensitive trimming and normalization for model names and IDs to ensure matches are found even with inconsistent QSC string formatting.

---

## BETA 0.0.2 - MVP Demo (3 Days Sprint)

### IGIPath Resolution Fix
- **Fixed `IGI_GAME_PATH` placeholder issue**: `GetLevelQVMPath()` now correctly reads `IGIPath` from the executable directory's `config.ini` instead of using a relative path that was picking up placeholder values from the project root
- **Added detailed path logging**: New log entry shows the resolved IGIPath and the config file path being used: `[App] GetLevelQVMPath using IGIPath: D:\IGI1 (from config: D:\...\config.ini)`
- **Root cause**: Was using `.\config.ini` (relative to current working directory) instead of exe directory path

### Compiler/Decompiler Folder Cleaning
- **Automatic input/output folder cleanup**: Both `Compiler::Compile()` and `Decompiler::Decompile()` now clean their respective input and output directories before operations
- **Prevents stale file errors**: Removes old QSC/QVM files that could interfere with new compilation/decompilation operations
- **Detailed cleanup logging**: Reports number of items removed from each directory

### Config Loading Improvements
- **Exe-directory config resolution**: All config operations now consistently use the executable directory path via `GetExeDirectory()`
- **Eliminated config path ambiguity**: No more confusion about which config.ini is being read (project root vs exe directory)

### Technical Changes
- Modified `GetLevelQVMPath()` in `app.cpp` to construct full config path using `exeDir + "\\config.ini"`
- Added comprehensive logging in `GetLevelQVMPath()` to track IGIPath resolution
- Added folder cleaning logic in `compiler.cpp` (lines 54-69) and `decompiler.cpp` (lines 43-58)
- All config paths now resolve to: `<exe_directory>\config.ini`

### Build System
- Both Debug and Release configurations build successfully with MSVC 2022
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## BETA 0.0.1

### QSC Save Logic Improvements
- **Added `original_rot` tracking**: Store original rotation values from QSC during load to enable proper change detection
- **Change detection on save**: Only update objects whose position or rotation has genuinely changed compared to their originally loaded state
- **Terrain snap offset handling**: Added `snap_z_offset` field to track Z offset added by terrain snapping, subtracted during save to match game coordinates
- **Multi-line Building support**: Fixed `Task_New` line replacement for Buildings with child tasks (no closing paren on first line)
- **Snap-to-terrain sync**: After snapping objects to terrain, sync `original_pos.z` so snap-only changes don't count as user edits
- **Preserved formatting**: Maintain original line indentation and terminators (`;` or `,`) for multi-line blocks

### Key Fixes
- Fixed issue where all `EditRigidObj` entries were being rewritten after reset and save
- Fixed Z-axis position discrepancy between editor view and in-game (editor was saving snapped Z, game expects raw terrain Z)
- Fixed compiler errors caused by incorrect multi-line `Task_New` termination
- Improved float formatting with `%.10g` to preserve precision and avoid scientific notation

### Technical Details
- Modified `LevelObject` struct to include `original_rot` and `snap_z_offset` fields
- Updated `LevelObjects::Load()` to capture original rotation values from QSC arguments
- Updated `App::SnapObjectsToTerrain()` to store snap offset and sync original Z
- Updated `LevelObjects::SaveToQSC()` with comprehensive change detection logic
- Added detailed logging for skip/save operations during QSC save

### Compilation
- Successfully builds with MSVC 2022 (Visual Studio)
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
